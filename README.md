# ABOUT

In this repository, you will find the results of exercises that I have completed as part of a web development training at BeCode.org in Li√®ge. These various exercises are designed to help me learn the fundamentals of PHP.

All exercises are contained within a Docker container, which simplifies their execution on the learners' machines.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

- Various PHP exercises to build a strong foundation in web development.
- Docker configuration files to ensure a consistent and isolated environment.

## Information about the template used

### What is this ?
This template repository is a boilerplate setup for a PHP application.

Its current version ships with PHP 8.1, Mysql 8.0, phpMyAdmin and an Nginx server running on Alpine.
All of it orchestrated and run by Docker Compose.

### Requirements
Docker Engine and Docker Compose
